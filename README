== Description of Contents

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb
  for automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.

app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views
  use eRuby syntax.

app/views/layouts
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models
  the common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views,
  define a layout using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file
  named default.erb. Inside default.erb, call <% yield %> to render the
  view using this layout.

app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These
  are generated for you automatically when using script/generate for
  controllers. Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views
  into methods.

config
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the
  database, and other dependencies.

db
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all
  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.

doc
  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored
  when generated using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>

lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that
  doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory
  is in the load path.

public
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for
  images, stylesheets, and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers
  and the default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT
  of your web server.

script
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.

test
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the
  script/generate scripts, template test files will be generated for
  you and placed in this directory.

vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the
  plugins subdirectory.  This directory is in the load path.
